The __xchange__ library provides a framework for platform independent data exchange for structured data in C/C++, and
includes a JSON parser and emitter. 

While there are many excellent libraries out there that offer such capabilities for C++ and/or other object-oriented 
languages, support for structured data exchange is notably rare for standard C. The __xchange__ library aims to fill 
that niche, by providing a data exchange framework with a C90-compatible API that supports the interchange of 
arbitrary structured data between different platforms and different serialization formats with ease. The __xchange__ 
library also provides support for JSON formatting and parsing using the C90 standard out of the box. All that in a 
light-weight and fast package.

The __xchange__ library was created, and is maintained, by Attila Kov√°cs at the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard 
&amp; Smithsonian, and it is available through the [Smithsonian/xchange](https://github.com/Smithsonian/xchange) 
repository on GitHub. 

This site contains various online resources that support the library:
